Defect #1:  
   - Module: Backend Get Method
   - Id: 0001
   - Description: By inquiring users by non-existing page we get 200 status code instead of 404

   - Steps to reproduce:
                        - Put the proper url and a non-existing id in the method request
                        - Launch the request
                        - Verify the data retrieved

   - Expected result: The status code in response should be 404 not found
   - Actual result: The status code in response should be other than 200, ideally 404
   - Priority: low
